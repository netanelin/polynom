# polynom
Oop university course project.

This is a Math project that contains various Continuous functions. Including a class that represents a single Monom (ax^b) that has two variables coefficient and power, and another class that represents a Polynom which is a collection of Monoms that are saved in an ArrayList according to the size of each of their powers from highest to lowest.
Each of these classes has all different methods such as adding two Monoms of the same power, finding a derivative for a Polynom, checking if two Polynoms are equal etc.
This project also contains a polynomGraph class that creates a GUI of a polynom graph in a specific domain.
Junit tests included.
